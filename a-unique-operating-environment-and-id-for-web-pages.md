# A Unique Operating Environment and ID For Web Pages

Any web based content you create is often at risk of being unreadable in future browsers and operating systems.  Why not create a globally unique id attached to a virtual machine image that could render the webpage properly and make it future proof.  Virtual machines could also be connected to software applications.  Having a webpage or software application is of no use without the environment to run it in.
