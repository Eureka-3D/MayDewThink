# How to get rid of traffic circles, speed bumps and stop speeding altogether

Until self driving cars are ubiquitous cars and drivers alike will hate traffic circles, speed bumps and speeders.How can we eliminate all three area by area using cheap accessible technology.

With cellphones so cheap it only makes sense to couple them with a solar charger and then have then be the eyes on the street to recognize speeders and communicate with traffic lights on when to change from red to green.  AN app could be written that wirelessly communicates back and uses simple AI to detect cars speeding.  When this speeding is detected a signal is sent to the traffic light to make the light last longer.  This way drivers will be penalized for speeding at traffic lights.  Speeding is common but very few people run red lights.
